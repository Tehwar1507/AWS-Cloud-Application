Open the AWS CodeCommit console Select Make Archive Set the Archive name* to "wildrydes-site" Select Make From the Clone URL drop down, select Clone HTTPS Presently from your Cloud9 improvement climate:

From a terminal window run git clone and the HTTPS URL of the respository: ec2-user:/climate $ git clone https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/wildrydes-site Cloning into 'wildrydes-site'... caution: You seem to have cloned an unfilled vault. ec2-user:/climate $ Extra Github Step (This step is possibly required on the off chance that you're utilizing Github rather than Codecommit) ✅ Bit by bit headings
